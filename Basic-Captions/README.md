OpenTok.js Basic Captions
=======================

This sample application shows how to connect to an OpenTok session, publish a stream,
subscribe to a stream, and publish captions to a session.

> **Note** The demo requires a server that is running and is able to handle OpenTok captions. This server should also be able to generate sessions and tokens. 

## Demo

[![Open in StackBlitz](https://developer.stackblitz.com/img/open_in_stackblitz.svg)](https://stackblitz.com/fork/github/opentok/opentok-web-samples/tree/opentok-51006-refactor/Basic-Captions)

Enter your credentials in `config.js` and the application will work.

> Note: There is a devDependency `sirv-cli` in the project that is only necessary to run the demo on StackBlitz.

## Running the App

*Important:* Read the following sections of the main README file for the repository to set up
and test the application:

* [Setting up the test web service](../README.md#setting-up-the-test-web-service)
* [Configuring the application](../README.md#configuring-the-application)
* [Testing the application](../README.md#testing-the-application)

## Getting an OpenTok session ID, token, and API key

An OpenTok session connects different clients letting them share audio-video streams and send
messages. Clients in the same session can include iOS, Android, and web browsers.

**Session ID** -- Each client that connects to the session needs the session ID, which identifies
the session. Think of a session as a room, in which clients meet. Depending on the requirements of
your application, you will either reuse the same session (and session ID) repeatedly or generate
new session IDs for new groups of clients.

*Important*: This demo application assumes that only two clients -- the local Web client and
another client -- will connect in the same OpenTok session. For test purposes, you can reuse the
same session ID each time two clients connect. However, in a production application, your
server-side code must create a unique session ID for each pair of clients. In other applications,
you may want to connect many clients in one OpenTok session (for instance, a meeting room) and
connect others in another session (another meeting room).

**Token** -- The client also needs a token, which grants them access to the session. Each client is
issued a unique token when they connect to the session. Since the user publishes an audio-video
stream to the session, the token generated must include the publish role (the default). For more
information about tokens, see the OpenTok [Token creation
overview](https://tokbox.com/opentok/tutorials/create-token/).

**API key** -- The API key identifies your OpenTok developer account.

Upon starting up, the application executes the following code in the app.js file:

```javascript
// See the config.js file.
$(document).ready(function ready() {
  // Make an Ajax request to get the OpenTok API key, session ID, and token from the server
  $.get(SAMPLE_SERVER_BASE_URL + '/session', function get(res) {
    apiKey = res.apiKey;
    sessionId = res.sessionId;
    token = res.token;

    initializeSession();
  });
});
```
